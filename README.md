## ✨ Features

### 🎫 Digital Ticket Wallet
Never fumble for a paper ticket again. The **persistent bottom sheet** allows for a quick swipe-up gesture to access your active QR codes, NFC passes, or barcode tickets.
- **Offline Access:** Tickets are cached locally for access without internet.
- **Smart Sorting:** Active tickets appear first; expired tickets are archived automatically.

### ⭐ Dynamic Favorites
Save time by bookmarking your most frequented locations.
- **"Stations":** One-tap navigation to fixed locations like Home, Work, or your favorite gym.
- **"Friends":** Securely share locations with friends to navigate directly to their current live location (permission-based).

### ⏳ Time Travel Planning
A unique interface that allows you to "travel in time" to see transit conditions.
- **Future Planning:** Schedule trips for next week and see predicted traffic/transit delays.
- **Past Routes:** Review previous journeys to analyze travel time and cost.

### 📍 Smart Location Defaults
Streamlined input fields for faster booking.
- If the "From" field is left empty, the app intelligently defaults to your **current GPS location**.
- Adjusts automatically based on the context of your "Favorites" selection.

### 🛡️ Privacy Controls
Your location data belongs to you.
- **Ghost Mode:** completely hide your location from all friends.
- **Block List:** Specific controls to block individual users from seeing your live status.
- **Granular Permissions:** Choose to share "Precise" or "Approximate" location.

### 📳 Customizable Haptics & UI
- **Haptic Feedback:** Fine-tune the vibration strength for success, error, and warning states in `Settings > Haptics`.
- **Themes:** Supports System Light/Dark mode and custom high-contrast themes for accessibility.

### 🌍 Web Support (PWA)
Full Progressive Web App support means you can install this app on your desktop or mobile browser without an app store.
